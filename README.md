xmatrixjs
=========

An HTML5 (canvas) implementation of the [code rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_digital_rain) from The Matrix. It looks like the old 2D xmatrix hack for xscreensaver by Jamie Zawinski. 

It runs well in Chrome but seems to lag Firefox badly. If you're using Webkit, you can see a live demo here:
